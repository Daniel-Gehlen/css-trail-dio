# Report on CSS Web Developer Bootcamp

## Introduction
This report highlights the code developed during a CSS training bootcamp for web development with Michele Ambrosio . The project aims to create an educational web page for the "CSS Trail by DIO" (Digital Innovation One). The code is structured in HTML and styled with CSS, with special attention to responsiveness and attractive design.

## Methods
The HTML code defines the page structure, including a header (`<header>`), main sections (`<main>`), and a footer (`<footer>`). Styling is managed through the `styles.css` file, which incorporates the Raleway font from Google Fonts.

### HTML Structure
- **Header (`<header>`):** Contains a banner with a logo, title, description, and registration button.
- **Main (`<main>`):**
  - **Course Content (`<section id="course-content">`):** Details about the trail modules, highlighting themes and providing an overview of the content.
  - **Transform the World (`<section id="transform-world">`):** A visually appealing section using a background image and impactful message.
  - **Professional Challenges (`<section id="professional-challenges">`):** Highlights professional evolution and opportunities after completing the trail, accompanied by an illustrative image.
- **Footer (`<footer>`):** Presents the DIO logo and a link to register on the site.

### CSS Styling
- **Reset (`reset.css`):** Import of a CSS reset to normalize styles across browsers.
- **General Styles (`styles.css`):** Definition of global styles for all elements, such as font, box-sizing, and margins.
- **Body (`body`):** Styling for the page body background.
- **H2 (`h2`):** Specific styling for second-order titles.
- **P (`p`):** General style for paragraphs.
- **Sections (`section`):** Common margins and styles for sections.
- **Banner (`banner`):** Gradient background, images, and specific styles for the main banner.
- **Modules List (`#course-content .modules-list .module`):** Styling for the trail modules.
- **Transform World (`#transform-world`):** Style for the "Transform the World" section with a background image and overlaid text.
- **Professional Challenges (`#professional-challenges`):** Style for the professional challenges section with an illustrative image.
- **Footer (`footer`):** Style for the footer, including the DIO logo and registration link.

## Results
The code results in an educational and attractive web page, with a combination of visually appealing design and informative content about the DIO CSS trail. Responsiveness is considered, and the styling provides a consistent user experience.

## Conclusion
The CSS Web Developer bootcamp project resulted in a well-structured and styled web page. The methods used, from organizing the HTML to the details of styling in CSS, contribute to a professional and effective presentation of the content. This project exemplifies the practical application of essential skills for front-end developers.
